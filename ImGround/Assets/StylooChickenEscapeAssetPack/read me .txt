Hello

****ALL THE VALUES FOR ADJUSTMENTS ARE IN THE INFOS FILE*****

For FBX USERS Metallic, Roughness, Alpha may NOT WORK properly, 
you may be need to re plug them or ADJUST the value.


For GLTF GLB USERS: nothing to do, should work fine :)

If you are using UNREAL ENGINE please USE GLB,GLTF so you don't have to setup all the materials, 
but if you persist to use fbx files, then when importing CHECK FLIPPED -Y FOR NORMAL MAP option.
 

If you think my work is usefull, you can donate me a little thing in itch,
that would help me to make more FREE assets
